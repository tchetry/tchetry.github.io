title: Dual Boot Your Laptop Windows and Linux
---

There are a lot of websites explaining how to dual boot your new laptop or a machine. I will go over what I did :bowtie:

### Introduction
I will consider that you have a new laptop with windows installed in it. Backup your windows on a usb so that you can start over if something goes wrong.
On Windows:
* Search "Create a Recovery Drive"
	* "Back up system files to the recovery drive" and hit enter.
	* Insert USB drive
	* Write on USB
	* Follow prompts on screen
	* Remove USB and keep it safe until dual boot is complete.

### Installing Linux
I will post the steps here to install Fedora-Workstation flavored with __K Desktop Environment (KDE)__.
