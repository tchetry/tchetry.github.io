I am a graduate student at Ohio University, [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/physastro/). I am originally from Nepal and came here for my PhD. I am currently working in medium energy Particle Physics, focusing primarily in Hadron Spectroscopy. My interests also include Vector Mesons, Exotic Hadrons (d) for example.


Thanks for reading!
